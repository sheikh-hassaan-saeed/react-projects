# React Daily Learning Progress

This repository documents my progress as I learn React through:
- Projects from the Meta Front-End Developer Program
- Personal micro-projects (landing pages, components etc)
- Practical implementations of core concepts (props, forms, state, conditional rendering, routing)

## ðŸ’¼ Why This Matters

As a future frontend developer, Iâ€™m using this repo to:
- Build a **strong foundation in React**
- Create **real-world, reusable components**
- Get job-ready with clean and modern code

---
## ðŸŒ± What I'm Trying to Achieve

- Build components the way real companies do â€” clean, tested, reusable
- Understand *why* React works the way it does, not just how
- Document my learning journey publicly to stay accountable
- Turn this repo into proof-of-skill for clients and other opportunities
- Show recruiters that Iâ€™m not just learning â€” Iâ€™m shipping daily
